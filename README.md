# (NOT YET) A MARKDOWN PROCESSOR

This is a work in progress in the early stages of development.
More elaborate description will be added soon.

Thank you.

## CURRENT TEXT FILE FORMATTING RULES

Titles and paragraphs must be delimited by \n.

The first non-empty line must be a title and must start with a single #.
It should be the only title with a single # in the document.

All following titles must start with more than one # sign.
If a title contains more #'s than the previous, the difference should not be more than 1.

Right now the script only differentiate between headings and paragraphs.

The readme.html file is generated by the script from this text as an example for you to look at.

## HOW IT WORKS

: node main.js your-file.txt > output.html
