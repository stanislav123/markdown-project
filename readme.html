[!] This is a work in progress in the early stages of development.
The idea is to generate an html file with a nested structure that represents 
sections of a given markdown file.
<SECTION><HEADER><H1> CURRENT TEXT FILE FORMATTING RULES (FOR THE SAKE OF DEVELOPMENT PROCESS)</H1></HEADER>
Titles and paragraphs must be delimited by \n.

The first non-empty line must be a title and must start with a single #.
It should be the only title with a single # in the document.

All following titles must start with more than one # sign.
If a title contains more #'s than the previous, the difference should not be more than 1.

[!] Right now the script only differentiate between headings and paragraphs.

The readme.html file contained in the repository is generated by the script 
from this text as an example.
